 * Create a virtual enviroment 

       python3 -m venv venv
       
       source ./venv/bin/activate
 
 * installing packages

       pip instal -r requirements.txt

## How to run the project
### For mac and linux:
 * Location of module containing the app:

        export FLASK_APP=openingdoors.py

* Enable developers features like debugging:
    
        export FLASK_ENV=development

* Run the application:

## Features:

  ### Read TWO datasets from an API
  This project will first ingest a dataset from the Realty Mole Property API when searching for an address based on input provided by the user.
  * Property Records
  * Valuation Estimates
  * Comparable Listings
  ### Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set
  Description
  ### Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data
  Description
  ### Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up
  The project will include a requirements.txt file, allowing the user to install all dependencies using the dependency management tool of their choice. Instructions will be included for using venv to setup the project.
