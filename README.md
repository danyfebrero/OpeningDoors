# OpeningDoors
  Get your home’s value and see selling options. 
  This is my Final Project for Code Louisville Data Analytics 2.

## Project Brief
  * This is a web application that will show you your home value and selling options.
  * Uses Realty Mole Property API which give 50 calls per month for free
  * Streamlit will do the UI

## Requirements:
  * Streamlit
  * Pandas
  * 

## Features:
  * Read TWO data sets in with an API (or use two different APIs that have data you can combine to answer new questions). 
  * Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set. 
  * Make a visualization with matplotlib, seaborn, Tableau dashboard, Pandas pivot table and 1 matplotlib/seaborn plot, or Bokeh.
  * Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up.
  * Write 3 unit tests and include instructions on how the user can run them. This will mostly only apply if you’re building custom functions and classes.
  * Annotate your .py files with well-written comments and a clear README.md
